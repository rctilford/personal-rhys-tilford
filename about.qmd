### About Me

I am a proud nerd as evidenced by my adoration for the show Doctor Who. In my spare time, I love catching up with my friends and hearing about their lives on long meandering walks around town. I also enjoy practicing my many hobbies. Ask me about my record player refurbishment project if we ever get to meet.

### Education

I was homeschooled in grades K-12 by my parents who have both worked in higher-education. (*2009-2022*)

I study Mathematics, Computer Science, and Communication at Georgetown College in Kentucky. (*2022-2025*)

### Experience

I work as a Resident Advisor at Georgetown College. In this role, I facilitate a smooth transition to college life for all residents. (*2023-present*)

I have worked as a Mathematics Tutor both privately and in affiliation with Georgetown College. In this role, I organized lesson plans and led review sessions. (*2022-2023*)
