## Introduction

Some time ago I came across a fascinating mural project on social media. Each mural was made of thousands of dice arranged in a frame so that each dice was a single pixel in the image. I had largely forgotten about the piece until I came across another example of it created by [Dice Ideas](https://diceideas.com/) which is an organization that makes these murals by comission. On their website they have a tool that lets users upload a photo and get a digital example of what a dice mural might look like for that photo. I was curious to see how I could go about getting a spreadsheet that would show me what side of a dice would be face up for any photo so I got to work.

I realized early on that some of my work would be best expedited to professional image editing software. I prefer [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) because it is a free open source program with ample support documents online.
