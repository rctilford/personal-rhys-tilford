### The Definition

> **11.1.10 Definition** The **Cantor set** $\mathbb{F}$ is the intersection of the sets $F_n,n\in\mathbb{N}$, obtained by successive removal of open middle thirds, starting with $[0,1]$.

### Proving Key Properties

##### Property 1: The total length of the removed intervals is 1

###### Proof:

We will construct a convergent geometric series of the lengths of the removed open middle thirds.

We see from the visual that the length of the removed open middle thirds is the series:

$$
\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{9}+\frac{4}{27}+\frac{8}{81}+...
$$

First, Let's work with the denominator:

$$
=\frac{1}{3^1}+\frac{2}{3^2}+\frac{4}{3^3}+\frac{8}{3^4}+...
$$

Now we can tackle the numerator: 

$$
=\frac{2^0}{3^1}+\frac{2^1}{3^2}+\frac{2^2}{3^3}+\frac{2^3}{3^4}+...
$$

Now we have what we need to build a series: 

$$
=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{\frac{2^i}{3^{(i+1)}}}
$$

This isn't quite a geometric series though. We'll do some quick simplification to remedy this. We start by rewriting the denominator with exponent rules: 

$$
=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{\frac{2^i}{3*3^i}}
$$

Now we can pull the constant multiple outside the sum: 

$$
=\frac{1}{3}*\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}{\Bigl(\frac{2}{3}\Bigr)^i}
$$

Next we will apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series: 

$$
=\frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{3}}
$$

With some simplification we find that the sum is infact $1$: 

$$
=\frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}}=\frac{3}{3}=1
$$

##### Property 2: The Cantor set $\mathbb{F}$ contains no nonempty open interval as a subset

###### Proof:

For this proof we will use contradiction. We assume $\mathbb{F}$ contains a nonempty open interval. Well, we obtain each element in $\mathbb{F}$ by removing *open* intervals. This means that the remaining intervals in each element of $\mathbb{F}$ must be *closed*. So there can never be a nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{F}$.

##### Property 3: The Cantor set $\mathbb{F}$ has infinitely (even uncountably) many points

###### Proof:

We can think of the Cantor set as having points if we consider the endpoints of each interval. For example:

 - The first element would have $4$ key points:
    - $0$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, and $1$
 - The second element would have $8$ key points:
    - $0$, $\frac{1}{9}$, $\frac{2}{9}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{7}{9}$, $\frac{8}{9}$, and $1$
 - The third element would have $16$ key points:
    - $0$, $\frac{1}{27}$, $\frac{2}{27}$, $\frac{1}{9}$, $\frac{2}{9}$, $\frac{7}{27}$, $\frac{8}{27}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{19}{27}$, $\frac{20}{27}$, $\frac{7}{9}$, $\frac{8}{9}$, $\frac{25}{27}$, $\frac{26}{27}$, and $1$

One thing to note about all of these points is that we can convert them into a basde three system for more clarity.

Our base ten system operates as follows (we will use $\frac{8}{27}$ for this example):

$$
\frac{8}{27}=0. \overline{296} =2\frac{1}{10}+9\frac{1}{100}+6\frac{1}{1000}+2\frac{1}{10000}+9\frac{1}{100000}+6\frac{1}{1000000}+...
$$

Note that the denominators are all powers of ten.

For this exammple the decimal number goes off into infinity. Most of the other points of the Cantor set do as well.

Alternatively, here is $\frac{8}{27}$ in a base three system:

$$
\frac{8}{27}=0\frac{1}{3^0}+0\frac{1}{3^1}+2\frac{1}{3^2}+2\frac{1}{3^3}=(0.022)_3
$$

To find this we first try to check how many $27s$ are in $8$. Upon finding none, we write the first term $0\frac{1}{3^0}$. Now we multiply $8$ and $3$ to get $24$. Again, we check how many $27s$ are in $24$. Upon finding none, we write the second term $0\frac{1}{3^1}$. Now we multiply $24$ and $3$ to get $72$. Now we actually find $2$ $27s$ in $72$. so we write the third term $2\frac{1}{3^2}$. Now, since we found some $27s$, we subtract $2*27$ from $72$ to get $18$ and multiply $18$ by $3$ to get $54$. Now we find exactly two $27s$ in $54$ so we finish by writing the fourth term $2\frac{1}{3^3}$.

In fact, we can apply the method above to write any $x\in[0,1]$ in base 3 form using only the numbers $0$, $1$, and $2$.

:::{.callout-note}
$\frac{8}{27}$ is written with $0s$ and $2s$. This is significant because it is one of the endpoints of the intervals in the Cantor set. We can gather from this that all points in any element of the Cantor set will be written with $0s$ and $2s$ because the $1s$ correspond to the open middle thirds.
:::

Now we will write this topic more formally:

$$
x=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\frac{a_n}{3^n}}=(0.a_1a_2...a_n...)_3
$$

*where each $a_n$ is either $0$, $1$, or $2$.*
