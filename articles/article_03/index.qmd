### The Definition

> **11.1.10 Definition** The **Cantor set** $\mathbb{F}$ is the intersection of the sets $F_n,n\in\mathbb{N}$, obtained by successive removal of open middle thirds, starting with $[0,1]$.

### Proving Key Properties

##### Property 1: The total length of the removed intervals is 1

###### Proof:

##### Property 2: The Cantor set $\mathbb{F}$ contains no nonempty open interval as a subset

###### Proof:

##### Property 3: The Cantor set $\mathbb{F}$ has infinitely (even uncountably) many points

###### Proof:
