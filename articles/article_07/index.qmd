### Introduction

In the spring of 2018, I decided that I needed to create a unique signature that I could write quickly. This all came about becuase I was taking a dual credit art course at Georgetown College and I needed a symbol to sign my work. I wanted that this signature to be my initials to help make the symbol swifter to reproduce. After much trial and error I created a style that I liked and began to apply it in my drawings for the college course.

Sometime later, I began to see use for the symbol in new venues. I used the symbol when writing letters, signing for purchases, and even as a substitute for *Q.E.D.* at the end of Mathematical proofs. It was then that I began to see the symbol as an accessory of my identity and an increasingly important part of my brand.

Recently, I decided it would be useful to create a version of my signature in a digital form so I could apply it digital mediums of communication. This project is the product of that decision.

### Creating the SVG Logo

After debating between different types of images, I decided to make the signature as an SVG path. This format is especially versatile because it can be resized without degrading the image it self. This is accomplished with an elaborate list of vectors which can be resized as needed. In fact, the acronym *SVG* stands for *Scaleable Vector Graphic*.

The language used to create an SVG is very complicated so for the sake of time I decided to build my signiture in a [visual SVG path editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/). This free interface makes it very easy to build a path by dragging the points of each line segment to the desired location.

### Replacing the Default Logo with the Custom SVG

To replace the default branding with my signiture, I needed to find out where quarto found the title for the site in the `_quarto.yml` file. Luckily, someone else has tried changing the logo of their quarto website as well. This [site](https://ellakaye.co.uk/posts/2023-04-11_animated-logo/) developed by Ella Kaye has a lovely tutorial on putting a custom logo in the yaml setup material. The key is to place the html reference in the navbar title reference as depicted here.

Notice that the HTML code in [this yaml chunk](#yaml-code) does not include any styling options for the path. These will be added in the CSS file. This is why it is very important that the svg tag have a specific class. If it did not the styling rules we will use in our CSS file would apply to all svg tags in the website.

Immediately, I ran into some issues. The default title was gone but my signiture was nowhere to be seen. After trial, error, blood, sweat, and tears, I found one setting that hid the signature from me.

##### Overflow
The problem was with the overflow settings. By default the parent tags of the path were set to keep the overflow hidden. All I had to add a reference to each parent tag in the CSS file with the contents `overflow: visible;` as shown in [this code chunk](#css-code).

### Adjusting the Sizing and Location
The HTML code does include use the viewbox attribute in the SVG tag. The path is a child of the SVG element but the path only holds data and styling information. The SVG tag is the one that holds all the sizing and location information. That is stored in the `viewbox` attribute. It is a list of four entries:

 - `Min-x`: The x-coordinate of the top left corner.
 - `Min-y`: The y-coordinate of the top left corner.
 - `Width` of the viewport.
 - `Height` of the viewport.

The `Width` and `Height` variables are fairly self-explanatory but `Min-x` and `Min-y` are worth discussing in more depth. These two coodinates set the position of the view port. We can imagine the viewport as our screen when we've zoomed in really close in the [svg path editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) and maneuvered the graph so that the point we see in the top left corner of our screen has the coordinates (Min-x, Min-y).

### Creating the Animation

Creating the animation is one of the more straight forward parts of this project. We will focus on two path attributes:

 - `stroke-dasharray`
    - This command creates a series of dashes interspersed with blank spaces of equal length along the path. It takes one numeric argument representing the length of each dash.
 - `stroke-dashoffset`
    - This command allows the programmer to *move* the series of dashes forward or backward along the path. it takes one numeric argument representing the distance that the series of dashes should be moved.

For a visual and interactive example of these two commands in action, check out [this tutorial from Cassie Codes](https://www.cassie.codes/posts/creating-my-logo-animation/).

This animation is built by choosing a value for `stroke-dasharray` (the length of each dash) wide enough to make it so one dash can entirely fill the path. The space would also fill the path since the length of each dash is equal to the length of each space.

The next trick of this animation is finding the two values of `stroke-dashoffset` where the path is entirely full and another where it is entirely space. Then we can use the commands `animation` and `@keyframes` as seen in the [css code](#css-code) to create the animation.

### Brighten on Hover

The the color of my logo brightens slightly when the mouse hovers over it. This was accomplished by creating a css rule for the path element that only activates when the mouse is hovering over the div tag with the class `navbar-brand-container`.

### CSS Code

```CSS
svg.logo path {
    fill: none;
    overflow: visible;
    stroke: rgba(255,255,255,.7);
    stroke-width: 2;
    stroke-dasharray: 1800;
    stroke-dashoffset: 1800;
    animation: draw 1.5s linear forwards;
