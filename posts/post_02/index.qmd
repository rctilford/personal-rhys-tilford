### Introduction

Transport has always been a passion of mine. I have always adored Trains, Planes, Cars, Boats, and any other type of vehicle. As I matured I began to see transit through a new lens. The sights and sounds of large transport-oriented machinary no longer held my attention like they once did. A more humanistic view of transport caught my fancy and I began to take interest in transport equity for people from all socio-economic backgrounds.

It is well known that the automobile is a focal point in American society. That said, I was well into my teens before I noticed the consequences our car-centric culture causes for people who either can't afford to own a car or choose not to own a car. This realization invigorated my interest in public transport and walkable infrastructure. In this data exploration, I hope to shed some light on the state of urban rail transport systems in America and compare them to that of other first world countries.

### The Data

I found a fascinating data table on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metro_systems) Wikipedia page so I decided to pull it and analize it. Here is the code I used to pull it:

```{r}
#| eval: false
web_page <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metro_systems"

Tables <-
  web_page %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_elements("table")

MetroList <- 
  Tables %>% 
  purrr::pluck(1) %>%
  html_table() %>%
  select(1:9)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
setwd("C:/Users/Rhys Tilford/OneDrive/Documents/personal-rhys-tilford/posts/post_02")
MetroList <- read.csv(file = "MetroData.csv") %>% select(2:10)

```

Much to my dismay the data was riddled with miscellaneous junk. Here is the data inside MetroList:

```{r}
#| echo: false
MetroList %>% 
  DT::datatable(class = "table table-hover",
                style = "bootstrap",
                options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

Here are the problems I see in MetroList:

 - The name of the column that holds the number of stations on each system has a long and irrelevent name.
 - Several of the columns have units and footnote links in them.

I decided to import it to Rstudio and take a crack at cleaning it.

### Tidying

Optimistically, I decided to call this new table TidyMetroList.

##### Renaming Columns

The following code renames the columns with a unified naming system:

```{r}
#| eval: false
TidyMetroList <-
  MetroList %>%
  set_names(c("City",
              "Country",
              "Name",
              "ServiceOpened",
              "LastExpanded",
              "StationCount",
              "Lines",
              "SystemLength",
              "RidershipMillions"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
MetroList %>% 
  set_names(c("City", "Country", "Name", "ServiceOpened", "LastExpanded", "StationCount", "Lines", "SystemLength", "RidershipMillions")) %>%
  DT::datatable(class = "table table-hover",
                style = "bootstrap",
                options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

Much better! There's still more to go though. Next we can tackle the extra gunk in the columns.

##### Isolating the Data

We'll do this part with regular expressions and the `stringr` package. These are the main regular expressions we'll use:

> - `[]`: Grouping
>    - This element matches one of any character inside the brackets.
> - `|`: Alternation
>    - This element sperates two expressions. The computer will match one or the other.
> - `w`: Word
>    - This matches "word characters." It is very inclusive with what it defines as a word character so it needs to be used with care.
> - `s`: Whitespace
>    - This matches all forms of whitespace.
> - `d`: Digit
>    - This matches any natural number in the closed interval [0,9].
> - `.`: Dot
>    - This matches everything except linebreaks.
> - `+`: Plus
>    - This matches one or more of the expression it follows.
> - `?`: Optional
>    - This matches 0 or 1 of the expression it follows.
> - `{}`: Quantifier
>    - This matches the quantity in the curly-brackets.
> - `(?<=ExpressionHere)`: Positive Lookbehind
>    - This matches an expression before the main expression without including it in the result.
> - `(?=ExpressionHere)`: Positive Lookahead
>    - This matches an expression after the main expression without including it in the result.

This code uses regular expresssions to remove all of the gunk in the columns:
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: false
TidyMetroList <-
  TidyMetroList %>%
  mutate(ServiceOpened = as.numeric(str_replace_all(ServiceOpened, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         LastExpanded = as.numeric(str_replace_all(LastExpanded, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         Country = str_replace_all(Country, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", ""),
         Name = str_replace_all(Name, "\\[[\\w\\s]+\\]|\\([\\w\\s]+\\)", ""),
         StationCount = as.numeric(str_replace_all(StationCount, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         SystemLength = str_replace_all(SystemLength, "\\skm\\s|\\d+(\\.\\d+)?.mi|\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]|[\\(\\)]+", ""))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
MetroList %>% 
  set_names(c("City", "Country", "Name", "ServiceOpened", "LastExpanded", "StationCount", "Lines", "SystemLength", "RidershipMillions")) %>%
  mutate(ServiceOpened = as.numeric(str_replace_all(ServiceOpened, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         LastExpanded = as.numeric(str_replace_all(LastExpanded, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         Country = str_replace_all(Country, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", ""),
         Name = str_replace_all(Name, "\\[[\\w\\s]+\\]|\\([\\w\\s]+\\)", ""),
         StationCount = as.numeric(str_replace_all(StationCount, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         SystemLength = str_replace_all(SystemLength, "\\skm\\s|\\d+(\\.\\d+)?.mi|\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]|[\\(\\)]+", "")) %>%
  DT::datatable(class = "table table-hover",
                style = "bootstrap",
                options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

Lovely! Now there's only one problem. Notice that the `RidershipMillions` column still was not dealt with in the last command. That's because the parenthetical statements in that column show the timeframe in which the ridership data was collected. We'd rather not get rid of this data so hastily.

##### A Special Case

The following code will snatch the data from the parenthesis and drop it in a new column called `RidershipMillionsDataFrom`. Then it will remove the excess information from `RidershipMillions` like we did above.
```{r}
#| eval: false
TidyMetroList <-
  TidyMetroList %>%
  mutate(RidershipMillionsDataFrom = str_extract(RidershipMillions, "(?<=\\().+(?=\\))"),
         RidershipMillions = as.numeric(str_replace_all(RidershipMillions, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]|(\\().+(\\))", "")))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
TidyMetroList <- 
  MetroList %>% 
  set_names(c("City", "Country", "Name", "ServiceOpened", "LastExpanded", "StationCount", "Lines", "SystemLength", "RidershipMillions")) %>%
  mutate(ServiceOpened = as.numeric(str_replace_all(ServiceOpened, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         LastExpanded = as.numeric(str_replace_all(LastExpanded, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         Country = str_replace_all(Country, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", ""),
         Name = str_replace_all(Name, "\\[[\\w\\s]+\\]|\\([\\w\\s]+\\)", ""),
         StationCount = as.numeric(str_replace_all(StationCount, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]", "")),
         SystemLength = as.numeric(str_replace_all(SystemLength, "\\skm\\s|\\d+(\\.\\d+)?.mi|\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]|[\\(\\)]+", "")),
         Lines = as.numeric(Lines)) %>%
  mutate(RidershipMillionsDataFrom = str_extract(RidershipMillions, "(?<=\\().+(?=\\))"),
         RidershipMillions = as.numeric(str_replace_all(RidershipMillions, "\\[[\\w+\\s+]+\\]|(\\().+(\\))", "")))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
TidyMetroList  %>%
  DT::datatable(class = "table table-hover",
                style = "bootstrap",
                options = list(pageLength = 5,
                               buttons.buttons.classname = "btn btn-primary",
                               PagingTag = "button"))
```

### Ridership Data Analysis

##### Analysis

I would like to know what the average ridership is like for the five largest economies. So I start by removing any NA values with the command in the third line. Next, I group the dataset so the mutate command takes the mean of `RidershipMillions` for each country. Now I filter out the five countries of interest. The select command picks out the columns I choose and the distinct command removes superfluous rows.

```{r}
MetroRidershipGraphInput <-
  TidyMetroList %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  mutate(RidershipMillionsAvg = mean(RidershipMillions)) %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c("United States", "Germany", "India", "China", "Japan")) %>% 
  select(Country, RidershipMillionsAvg) %>% 
  distinct()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
MetroRidershipGraphInput  %>%
  DT::datatable(class = "table table-hover",
                style = "bootstrap",
                options = list(pageLength = 5,
                               buttons.buttons.classname = "btn btn-primary",
                               PagingTag = "button"))
```

##### Caveats

This data set is not a great indicator of how widely used urban rail transport is in these countries because we have no data in this dataset for the population that each metro system serves. If we did it would be very interesting to compare the average ridership divided by the average service zone population.
